    "- `sample_rate_hertz` - Sample rate can be detected from the audio `.wav` file and resampled if needed.\n",
    "- `language_code` - Language of the input audio. \"en-US\" represents English (US). Other options include (`es-US`, `de-DE`, `ru-RU`, `zh-CN`). We will explore ASR for non-English languages in the next section.\n",
    "- `enable_automatic_punctuation` - Adds a punctuation at the end of VAD (Voice Activity Detection).\n",
